# Python-Keylogger

# What is a Keylogger
A keylogger is a program that monitors and records your keyboard inputs to ensure that every keystroke is captured. It can be used with malicious softwate  by stealing passwords, credit card numbers, or sensitive data.

# How it works 
The Python script used in this  is a basic keylogger that records every key pressed on the keyboard and saves it to a file called keyfile.txt. It uses the keyboard module to detect key presses in real-time.
When a key is pressed, the script logs the keyâ€™s name (like a, enter, shift, etc.).
The keylogger keeps running until manually stopped.
The purpose of this script is for educational and ethical hacking practice only.

# Key Terms to Know
-Keylogger: A program or device that records the keystrokes made by a user. Often used for monitoring or debugging, but can be misused if deployed maliciously.

-Keyboard Module: A Python library that allows programs to interact with the keyboard (e.g., detect key presses).

-Event: In programming, an action or occurrence (like a key press) that the program can detect and respond to.

-Threading: A method of running tasks in the background, so the program can listen for keystrokes while doing other things if needed.

-Listener: A function or process that waits for a specific event (in this case, a key press) and triggers an action when it happens.
